This project introduces a smart, offline-first system designed to bring transparency, accountability, and ease to rural waste collection — especially in areas still relying on manual, paper-based tracking. By creating a simple yet powerful connection between PDOs (Panchayat Development Officers), SHGs (Self-Help Groups), Workers, and Households, the system ensures that every waste pickup is verifiable and traceable, even in areas with poor internet access.
How the System Solves the Real Problems on the Ground:
->Offline-First Logging for Workers
Workers use a lightweight mobile app that works even without internet.
They log each pickup by capturing a photo, GPS location, and timestamp.
The data is safely stored on their phone and automatically synced once they regain connectivity.
This replaces messy paper registers and reduces errors or manipulation.
-> Household Confirmation for Trust
Once the log is synced, households receive a record of the pickup — including the photo and time — on their own app interface.
They can then confirm or reject the service with a simple tap.
This builds trust and creates a reliable record for both the community and the workers.
->SHG Dashboard for Assignments and Monitoring
SHGs get a clear admin panel where they can assign daily routes to workers and monitor task completion.
It helps ensure that all assigned areas are being covered — and highlights if anything gets missed.
->PDO Dashboard for Oversight and Disputes
PDOs can log in and see a bigger picture:
Which pickups were completed, which were disputed, and where problems are repeating.
They can step in to resolve any issues by checking the logged data and household responses.
->Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement
Households can submit service feedback — even if they’re offline at the time.
The feedback gets synced later and is reviewed by SHGs and PDOs to improve operations and service quality.
->Cloud Sync and Data Transparency
All data flows through a central cloud database (like Firebase or MySQL), so stakeholders can see what’s happening — either in real time or whenever they’re online.
This keeps everyone informed, aligned, and accountable.
